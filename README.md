Billboard Ranking from: https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/
Date of Data 24.03.25


I have decided to get the top 100 Billboard Songs and use the lyrics including some additional data like artist, song name etc.
To get the lyrics i used https://www.lyricsify.com/ and then made it into an txt file.

The LR-Project is done in python since its simple and effective for the given assignemnt.
