[00:20.03]You know I'm impatient
[00:22.48]So why would you leave me waiting outside the station
[00:25.65]When it was like minus four degrees?
[00:27.49]And I, I get what you're sayin'
[00:31.24]I just really don't wanna hear it right now
[00:34.00]Can you shut up for like once in your life?
[00:37.37]Listen to me, I took your nice words of advice
[00:40.48]About how you think I'm gonna die lucky if I turn 33
[00:43.88]Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
[00:46.20]I'm not skinny, and I pull a Britney every other week
[00:50.23]But cut me some slack, who do you want me to be?
[00:54.47]Because I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
[00:58.66]You told me, "Get a job", then you ask where the hell I've been
[01:03.16]And I'm too perfect 'til I open my big mouth
[01:07.61]I want to be me, is that not allowed?
[01:12.04]And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
[01:16.12]You hate it when I cry unless it's that time of the month
[01:20.47]And I'm too perfect 'til I show you that I'm not
[01:24.31]A thousand people I could be for you, and you hate the fucking lot
[01:31.15]You hate the fucking lot
[01:35.68]You hate the fucking lot
[01:40.13]You hate, you hate
[01:46.29]It's taking you ages
[01:48.95]You still don't get the hint, I'm not asking for pages
[01:52.06]But one text or two would be nice
[01:53.81]And please, don't pull those faces
[01:57.58]When I've been out working my ass off all day
[02:00.47]It's just one bottle of wine or two, but hey
[02:03.99]You can't even talk, you smoke weed just to help you sleep
[02:07.21]Then why you out getting stoned at four o'clock
[02:09.91]And then you come home to me?
[02:12.42]And don't say hello 'cause I got high again and forgot to fold my clothes
[02:20.99]'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
[02:25.36]You told me, "Get a job", then you ask where the hell I've been
[02:29.63]And I'm too perfect 'til I open my big mouth
[02:34.03]I want to be me, is that not allowed?
[02:38.16]And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
[02:42.40]You hate it when I cry unless it's that time of the month
[02:46.91]And I'm too perfect 'til I show you that I'm not
[02:50.74]A thousand people I could be for you, and you hate the fucking lot
[02:57.60]You hate the fucking lot
[03:02.24]You hate the fucking lot
[03:05.58]
[03:28.12]Oh, and I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
[03:34.57]You told me, "Get a job", then you ask where the hell I've been
[03:38.91]And I'm too perfect 'til I open my big mouth
[03:43.33]I want to be me, is that not allowed?
[03:47.42]And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
[03:51.83]You hate it when I cry unless it's that time of the month
[03:56.31]And I'm too perfect 'til I show you that I'm not
[03:59.94]A thousand people I could be for you, and you hate the fucking lot
[04:06.98]You hate the fucking lot
[04:11.10]You hate the fucking lot
[04:15.58]You hate the fucking lot
[04:19.88]You hate the fucking lot
