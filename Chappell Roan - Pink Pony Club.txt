[00:09.32]I know you wanted me to stay
[00:13.56]But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
[00:17.70]And I heard that there's a special place
[00:22.79]Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day
[00:27.75]I'm having wicked dreams
[00:30.08]Of leaving Tennessee
[00:32.40]Oh, Santa Monica
[00:34.55]I swear it's calling me
[00:36.84]Won't make my mama proud
[00:39.25]It's gonna cause a scene
[00:41.44]She sees her baby girl
[00:43.84]I know she's gonna scream
[00:45.78]God, what have you done
[00:49.04]You're a pink pony girl
[00:51.21]And you dance at the club
[00:52.97]Oh mama, I'm just having fun
[00:58.12]On the stage in my heels
[01:00.42]It's where I belong down at the

[01:05.97]I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
[01:08.57]Pink Pony Club
[01:10.69]I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
[01:12.98]West Hollywood
[01:15.12]I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
[01:17.43]Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club
[01:22.08]I'm up and jaws are on the floor
[01:26.48]Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
[01:30.80]Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball
[01:35.30]Every night's another reason why I left it all
[01:40.16]I thank my wicked dreams
[01:42.43]A year from Tennessee
[01:44.46]Oh, Santa Monica
[01:47.02]You've been too good to be
[01:49.05]Won't make my mama proud
