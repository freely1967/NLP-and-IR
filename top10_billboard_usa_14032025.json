(Yeah, yeah)\nWho's callin' my phone? (OVO Sound, 2025)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone?\n\n[Chorus: Elkan & Drake]\nIs it Stacy? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it Becky? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it Keisha? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it Ashley? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nWas it Dani? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it PARTY? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nWhere's the function? (Where the fuck the function?)\nSend the addy (Where the fuck the function?)\n\n[Verse: Drake]\nThe way I feel right now, I feel like we need to be all alone\nSo if you just playin' around, you need to tell your girl, \"Take your fine ass home,\" and that's real\nStop teasin' me, yeah, what? Stop teasin' me\nI could change your life so easily\nI keep beggin' you to stay, but you're leavin' me\nLeavin' me, we got sticks in the club illegally\nGot the whole 6ix side, they believe in me\nWe got members east of the DVP\nWe got members west on the 401\nWe had a lock on the game, but it's more to come\nYou gotta pop that ass 'til the morning come\nYou want shots for the girls? Then order some\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that?)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)\nWho's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)\nWho's callin' my— (Ayy)\n\n[Chorus: Elkan & Drake]\nIs it Stacy? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it Becky? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it Keisha? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it Ashley? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nWas it Dani? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nIs it PARTY? (Who's callin' my phone?)\nWhere's the function? (Where the fuck the function?)\nSend the addy (Where the fuck the function?)\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Intro: Elkan]\nBaby girl\nBaby girl\nBaby girl\n[Chorus: Drake & Elkan]\nBaby girl\nLet me see you do your dance, let me see you twirl\nShakin' ass in the club with your homegirls\nTake a pic for the 'Gram, show the whole world (Show the whole world), yeah\nIs that your bestie?\nI'ma ice both of y'all like Gretzky\nI'ma at you like bless me\nHit the dance floor, get nasty, impress me\nBaby girl\nLet me see you do your dance, let me see you twirl\nShakin' ass in the club with your homegirls\nTake a pic for the 'Gram, show the whole world (Show the whole world), yeah\nIs that your bestie?\nI'ma ice both of y'all like Gretzky\nI'ma at you like bless me\nHit the dance floor, get nasty, impress me"
