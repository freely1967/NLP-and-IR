[00:12.22]It's fine, it's cool
[00:16.09]You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
[00:20.28]And guess I'm the fool
[00:24.20]With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof
[00:29.30]I don't wanna call it off
[00:31.56]But you don't wanna call it love
[00:33.53]You only wanna be the one that I call "Baby"
[00:37.26]You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
[00:41.02]Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
[00:45.35]You can say it's just the way you are
[00:49.55]Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
[00:53.18]Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[00:54.97]Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[00:57.26]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[01:01.47]Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[01:03.36]Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[01:05.52]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[01:09.51]I'm clich√©, who cares
[01:13.75]It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
[01:17.84]And I cry, it's not fair
[01:21.98]I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air
[01:27.15]Think I'm gonna call it off
[01:29.19]Even if you call it love
[01:31.22]I just wanna love someone who calls me "Baby"
[01:34.88]You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
[01:38.73]Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
[01:42.98]You can say it's just the way you are
[01:47.05]Make a new excuse, another stupid reason

[01:54.87]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[01:59.25]Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[02:01.16]Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[02:03.16]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[02:14.66]Ooh, and when you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
[02:19.66]With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
[02:23.72]And when you think about me all of those years ago
[02:27.99]You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
[02:32.03]You know I hate to say it, "I told you so"
[02:36.45]You know I hate to say it, but, "I told you so"
[02:41.04]You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
[02:44.78]Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (well, I told you so)
[02:48.83]You can say it's just the way you are
[02:52.92]Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
[02:56.84]Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[02:58.60]Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[03:00.78]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[03:04.87]Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
[03:06.62]Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
