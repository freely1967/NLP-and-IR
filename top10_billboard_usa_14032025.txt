[Intro]
If this world were mine

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
Fah-fah, fah-fah-fah, fah-fah, fah
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
It's a vibe, do your dance, let 'em watch
She a fan, he a flop, they just wanna kumbaya, nah

[Chorus: SZA, SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure
If this world were—
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see
If this world were mine

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure
If this world were—
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see
If this world were mine

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
I can't lie
I trust you, I love you, I won't waste your time
I turn it off just so I can turn you on
I'ma make you say it loud
I'm not even trippin', I won't stress you out
I might even settle down for you, I'ma show you I'm a pro
I'ma take my time and turn it off
Just so I can turn you on, baby
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure

[Outro: SZA]
I know you're comin' for
Better days
If this world were mine

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Psst, I see dead people
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor

[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)
Say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way

[Outro]
Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way

[Part I]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
All I ever wanted was a black Grand National
Fuck being rational, give 'em what they ask for

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
They like, "What he on?"
It's the alpha and omega, bitch, welcome home
This is not a song
This a revеlation, how to get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and makе you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, turn his TV off
Ain't with my type activities? Then don't you get involved
Hey, what, huh, how many should I send? Send 'em all
Take a risk or take a trip, you know I'm trippin' for my dog
Who you with? Couple sergeants and lieutenants for the get back
This revolution been televised, I fell through with the knick-knacks
Hey, young nigga, get your chili up, yeah, I meant that
Hey, black out if they act out, yeah, I did that
Hey, what's up, though?
I hate a bitch that's hatin' on a bitch and they both hoes
I hate a nigga hatin' on them niggas and they both broke
If you ain't coming for no chili, what you come for?
Nigga feel like he entitled 'cause he knew me since a kid
Bitch, I cut my granny off if she don't see it how I see it, hm
Got a big mouth but he lack big ideas
Send him to the moon, that's just how I feel, yellin'
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough

Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't no other king in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA, yellin'
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Mustard (Ah, man)
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long

I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

[Verse 2]
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh
[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

[Part I]

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Yeah, yeah)
Who's callin' my phone? (OVO Sound, 2025)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone?

[Chorus: Elkan & Drake]
Is it Stacy? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it Becky? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it Keisha? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it Ashley? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Was it Dani? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it PARTY? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Where's the function? (Where the fuck the function?)
Send the addy (Where the fuck the function?)

[Verse: Drake]
The way I feel right now, I feel like we need to be all alone
So if you just playin' around, you need to tell your girl, "Take your fine ass home," and that's real
Stop teasin' me, yeah, what? Stop teasin' me
I could change your life so easily
I keep beggin' you to stay, but you're leavin' me
Leavin' me, we got sticks in the club illegally
Got the whole 6ix side, they believe in me
We got members east of the DVP
We got members west on the 401
We had a lock on the game, but it's more to come
You gotta pop that ass 'til the morning come
You want shots for the girls? Then order some

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)
Who's callin' my— (Ayy)

[Chorus: Elkan & Drake]
Is it Stacy? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it Becky? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it Keisha? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it Ashley? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Was it Dani? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Is it PARTY? (Who's callin' my phone?)
Where's the function? (Where the fuck the function?)
Send the addy (Where the fuck the function?)

Ayy, how many hoes in this club?

And you're just like me, if it's true, my love, ayy
You could see right through my love, ayy
I see your waist shrunk, my love, ayy
You got some bass in the trunk, my love, damn
How many hoes in this club?
Is it really just me, my love?
You know my dad 'nem pimpin' for real
You ever been down to Memphis, Tennessee, my love? Uh

I got drinks, jokes, sex, and cash
Those are four things I can guarantee, my love, ayy
