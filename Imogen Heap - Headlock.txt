[length: 03:35]
[00:17.09]Distant flickering, greener scenery
[00:20.96]This weather's bringing it all back again
[00:24.42]Great adventures, faces in condensation
[00:29.13]I'm going outside and take it all in
[00:32.75]You say too late to start
[00:35.00]Got your heart in a headlock
[00:38.21]I don't believe any of it
[00:41.14]You say too late to start
[00:42.90]With your heart in a headlock
[00:46.34]You know you're better than this
[00:50.33]
[00:56.62]Wear a different pair, just something out of step
[01:01.07]Throw a stranger an unexpected smile
[01:05.01]With big intention, still posted at your station
[01:09.13]Always on about the day it should have flown

[01:15.03]Got your heart in a headlock
[01:18.41]I don't believe any of it
[01:21.04]You say too late to start
[01:22.98]With your heart in a headlock
[01:26.60]You know you're better than this
[01:29.08]Afraid to start
[01:31.18]Got your heart in a headlock
[01:34.65]I don't believe any of it
[01:36.94]You say too late to start
[01:39.09]With your heart in a headlock
[01:42.54]You know you're better than this
[01:45.21](You've) been walking, you've been hiding
[01:48.89]And you look half dead half the time
[01:52.75]Monitoring you, like machines do
[01:56.82]You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye
[02:00.72](You've) been walking, you've been hiding
[02:04.44]And you look half dead half the time
[02:08.88]Monitoring you, like machines do
[02:12.94]You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye
[02:18.53]
[02:35.08]You know you're better than this
[02:37.34]Come back and start
[02:39.04]Got your heart in a headlock

[02:53.21]Afraid to start
[02:55.13]Got your heart in a headlock
[02:58.56]I don't believe any of it
