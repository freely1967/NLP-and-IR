[00:07.86]Ooh, yeah
[00:11.98]Ooh, yeah
[00:15.49]I can feel it
[00:17.88]Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
[00:21.60]I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
[00:25.53]I can see myself and I'm not breathing, ah
[00:29.11]I'm not breathing (I'm not breathing), slowly bleeding (bleeding)
[00:33.61]I wish that I told you all my feelings (feelings)
[00:37.78]I hope that I live life for a reason (reason)
[00:41.70]But at least you played this song when I'm gone
[00:46.55]And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
[00:51.15]Every night for you
[00:53.45]Take it easy on me, baby
[00:55.45]'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
[00:59.28]End of time with you
[01:01.62]Now we're strangers
[01:02.52]And I hope that you still cry for me like I cried for you
[01:07.23]Every night for you
[01:09.48]I've been living with this lie, now I can't hide the truth
[01:13.23]I can't hide the truth
[01:15.21]Girl, I'll cry for you
[01:17.22]Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[01:20.43]I can't see clear, I wash my fears
[01:24.28]With whiskey tears
[01:28.27]I disappear, don't interfere
[01:32.25]The end is near
[01:36.39]The crowd will scream, I block my ears
[01:40.13]To stop the cheers
[01:43.47]'Cause this stage took a toll, been faded on the floor
[01:47.36]In this penthouse prison, I'm alone
[01:50.75]And I hope you'll cry for me like I cry for you
[01:55.33]Every night for you
[01:57.45]Take it easy on me, baby
[01:59.34]'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
[02:03.20]End of time with you
[02:05.26]Now we're strangers
[02:06.67]And I hope that you still cry for me like I cried for you
[02:11.31]Every night for you
[02:13.38]I've been living with this lie, now I can't hide the truth
[02:17.15]I can't hide the truth (hide the truth)
[02:19.31]Girl, I'll cry for you
[02:21.23]Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[02:24.31]Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
[02:29.47]Kills me slowly (slowly)
[02:32.49]When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
[02:37.29]Now you're over me (over me)
[02:40.39]Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fuckin' mystery
[02:45.22]You've been showing me
[02:48.13]Now I've been burning up my home, baby
[02:52.38]I've been burning up my home
[02:54.65]And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
[02:59.34]Every night for you
[03:01.20]Take it easy on me, baby
[03:03.39]'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
