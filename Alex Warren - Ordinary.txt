[00:08.15]They say, "The holy water's watered down
[00:11.80]And this town's lost its faith
[00:14.08]Our colors will fade eventually"
[00:17.26]So, if our time is runnin' out
[00:20.69]Day after day
[00:22.75]We'll make the mundane our masterpiece
[00:26.79]Oh, my, my
[00:28.83]Oh, my, my love
[00:32.36]I take one look at you
[00:33.97]You're takin' me out of the ordinary
[00:37.82]I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
[00:42.46]On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
[00:47.16]The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
[00:51.23]Somethin' so out of the ordinary
[00:54.98]You got me kissin' thе ground of your sanctuary
[00:59.24]Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return mе to dust
[01:04.69]The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
[01:10.22]Hopeless hallelujah
[01:14.24]On this side of Heaven's gate
[01:18.68]Oh, my life, how do ya
[01:22.85]Breathe and take my breath away?
[01:28.03]At your altar, I will pray
[01:30.33]You're the sculptor, I'm the clay
[01:32.88]Oh, my, my
[01:34.06]You're takin' me out of the ordinary
[01:37.76]I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
[01:42.08]On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
[01:47.53]The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
[01:51.32]Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary (Ordinary)
[01:55.12]You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)
[01:59.14]Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return me to dust
[02:04.46]The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
[02:09.32]Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
[02:13.72]Whenever you're next to me, oh, my, my
[02:18.03]World was in black and white until I saw your light
[02:22.31]I thought you had to die to find
[02:25.57]Somethin' so out of the ordinary
[02:29.33]I want you laying me down 'til we're dead and buried
[02:33.44]On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
[02:38.64]The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
[02:42.69]Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary
[02:46.56]You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)
[02:50.80]Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return me to dust
[02:55.95]The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
