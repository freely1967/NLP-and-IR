[length: 03:43]
[00:00.38]Abracadabra, abracadabra
[00:04.18]Abracadabra, abracadabra
[00:08.02]
[00:15.82]Pay the toll to the angels
[00:18.98]Drawin' circles in the clouds
[00:23.23]Keep your mind on the distance
[00:26.70]When the devil turns around
[00:30.91]Hold me in your heart tonight
[00:34.27]In the magic of the dark moonlight
[00:38.42]Save me from this empty fight
[00:43.67]In the game of life
[00:46.02]Like a poem said by a lady in red
[00:49.50]You hear the last few words of your life
[00:53.31]With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
[00:57.10]It's time to cast your spell on the night
[01:01.31]"Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
[01:04.94]Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
[01:08.91]Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na"
[01:12.26]In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"
[01:18.66]Abracadabra, abracadabra
[01:22.30]Abracadabra, abracadabra
[01:26.10]Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on firе
[01:29.90]Abracadabra, abracadabra
[01:33.71]Choose the road on the wеst side
[01:37.10]As the dust flies, watch it burn
[01:41.34]Don't waste time on a feelin'
[01:44.70]Use your passion, no return
[01:48.91]Hold me in your heart tonight
[01:52.27]In the magic of the dark moonlight
[01:56.54]Save me from this empty fight
[02:01.64]In the game of life
[02:03.92]Like a poem said by a lady in red
